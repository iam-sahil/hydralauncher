# Hydra Launcher Website (Unofficial)

Welcome to the unofficial website for **Hydra Launcher**, an open-source game launcher designed to enhance your gaming experience.

This is just a personal project I made to show my CSS design and promote a project I use on a daily basis.

## 🚀 Hydra Launcher Features

- **Embedded BitTorrent Client**: Hydra comes with its own integrated BitTorrent client, allowing for seamless game downloads without the need for external applications.
- **Automated Repack Scraper**: Automatically gathers the latest game repacks from trusted sources, ensuring you have access to up-to-date content.
- **HowLongToBeat Integration**: Displays estimated game completion times, helping you plan your gaming sessions effectively.
- **Customizable Download Paths**: Offers flexible settings to choose and customize your preferred directories for game installations and downloads.
- **Regular Updates**: Continuously updated to enhance performance, add new features, and ensure compatibility with the latest technologies.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with both Windows and Linux operating systems, catering to a wide range of users.
